Having a marketing budget is just as important as knowing what
activities to fund. When building a marketing program, start by doing
one or two marketing activities really well then build that into a
comprehensive program over time.

This will ensure activities with your brand name attached reflect
positively on your organization. Every action you take sends a signal of
quality to your target audience. It is far better to create one
extraordinary piece of content than ten mediocre ones that could damage
your credibility.

As for the actual dollar amount, this is what the U.S. Small Business
Administration recommends you spend:

> *As a general rule, \[organizations\] with revenues less than $5
> million should allocate 7-8% of their revenues to marketing.*

**U.S. Small Business Administration Â» ["How to Set a Marketing Budget
that Fits your Business Goals and Provides a High Return on Investment"][3]
(June 2012)**

This means if your organization falls within that range you want to be
spending **up to $400,000 annually** on your marketing budget.

If your organization generates *more than $5 million* in annual revenue,
I have seen other experts recommend a decrease in that percentage. For
example, an organization earning more than $300 million in annual revenue
may want to budget 4% of revenue toward marketing. This approximates to
**$12+ million annually**.

It is worth noting that each industry has its own standards. Some will
budget more, and some will budget less. Red Bull likely spends
[between 30% and 40% of revenue][4] on their marketing programs. The
values presented here are used to give you an idea where to start.

With a budget firmly in hand you gain a much better sense which
marketing activities fit your business.
