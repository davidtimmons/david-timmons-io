These are the files for my [personal website](https://david.timmons.io "Visit my website!"). The design is inspired by the user interfaces seen in Sci-Fi movies and television shows. The code structure is simple, making heavy use of *[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)* for styling.

## Note to Self

Files for the published website are located in the `docs` directory. Execute the command
`npm run build:prod` to build these files.
