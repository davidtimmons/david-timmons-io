Business marketing segmentation can make the difference between a
prospect who calls *you* and a prospect who calls your *competition*.

Business marketing principles often overlap with consumer marketing, but
business marketing is unique because it focuses on an organizational
decision-making process rather than the individual consumer. Your
success in business marketing depends, in part, on telling the right
story to the right organization via prospect segmentation.

The segmentation process partitions your business marketing message
along pre-built lines you specify. Since each group within your
segmented prospect list receives a unique message, this can dramatically
increase response rates. Clearly, a management team in the restaurant
business is more likely to respond to a business marketing message
focused on "cutting-edge kitchen equipment" than "cutting-edge medical
equipment".

While this is an obvious example, you can segment your business
marketing lists using variables that fit best with your overall
strategy. In consumer marketing we often use
[demographic](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demographics "Click here to read a definition of demographics.")
and
[psychographic](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychographics "Click here to read a definition of psychographics.")
factors to accomplish this. However, in business marketing, we use
[firmographics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmographics "Click here to read more about firmographics.").

Firmographics are segmentation variables such as industry, company
location, number of employees, and yearly revenue. The first step is to
compile data on organizations you consider prospects. Then, using data
scrubbing techniques - and sometimes statistical analysis - you arrive
at a business marketing list containing your firmographic
classifications alongside pertinent contact information.

Stop here. Examine how your prospects are clustered around your
firmographic classifications. Is 84% percent of your business marketing
list located in Texas and 16% in Pennsylvania? Then don't bother
optimizing your campaign landing pages for business search trends in
California. Your segmentation data will help you make rational business
marketing decisions that maximize your response rate.

Business marketing segmentation through the use of firmographics helps
you target your promotional efforts. This leads to greater success.
