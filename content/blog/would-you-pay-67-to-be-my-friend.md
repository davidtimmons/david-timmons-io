Every marketing "call to action" has an associated cost to your
prospect. How much does yours cost?

\[/caption\]

Marketing communicates the value of your product or service. This often
leads to a transaction. We shout our "call to action" and hope the money
rolls in, but there are times when the *virtual* currency we ask our
customers to pay stops a transaction before the *cash* price is ever a
discussion point.

How many times in your marketing career have you directed a potential
customer to "like us on Facebook" or "sign up for our newsletter"? These
are small, seemingly innocent requests. And yet, you are asking your
prospect to pay you in virtual currency.

While these actions don't have a dollar value, they have a concrete
virtual value. You are requesting payment any time you ask a prospect to
complete one of these tasks:

1.  Think
2.  Decide
3.  Commit
4.  Act against ingrained biases

So what does your prospect consider when evaluating your request to sign
up for an email newsletter, for example? It will be different for each
"user profile" you create when planning your marketing campaign.

Nevertheless, using arbitrary **VC**, or **Virtual Currency** amounts,
here is what a particular user might think when encountering your
newsletter sign-up request:

-   How interested am I in hearing from them? [(+ 1
    VC)]{style="color:#888;"}
-   Where did they hide the sign-up form on this website? [(+ 10
    VC)]{style="color:#888;"}
-   Are they going to sell my name to advertisers? [(+ 2
    VC)]{style="color:#888;"}
-   What does the privacy policy say? [(+ 19 VC)]{style="color:#888;"}
-   Am I going to be bombarded with their email messages? [(+ 5
    VC)]{style="color:#888;"}
-   Where was that sign-up form again? [(+ 1 VC)]{style="color:#888;"}
-   Wait a minute. Why are they asking me for more information than my
    name and email address? [(+ 9 VC)]{style="color:#888;"}
-   A CAPTCHA? I *hate* those things... [(+ 20 VC)]{style="color:#888;"}

[**TOTAL COST: 67 VC** (Virtual Currency)]{.highlight}

Imagine that amount in U.S. dollars. How many of your prospects are so
eager to participate with your brand they would pay you **\$67** for the
privilege of receiving your newsletters?

Very likely, none. No one. Not a single person.

Each call to action you generate in the course of your marketing
campaign has both a cash value and a virtual currency value. If you want
to reduce your virtual currency cost and generate a transaction, these
are your options:

1.  Limit your calls to action.
2.  Streamline the process for answering your calls to action.

It would be a shame to scare away your prospects with a virtual currency
price tag only a "millionaire" could afford.

How do you minimize virtual currency costs in your marketing approach?
