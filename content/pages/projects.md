These projects are highlights from my past and current development work.
I love the creative challenge inherent in problem solving and
continually teach myself new skills to expand my repertoire. While some
projects here are proprietary, many are not. Everything below is my own
work unless specifically stated otherwise.

*Mega Air Man* is a game demo written in
*[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/ "Click here to learn more about Elm.")* and
based on the NES classic *Mega Man 2*. *Elm* is a cutting-edge ML-style
language similar to *Haskell* that natively supports a functional
reactive architecture in client-side Web applications.

Component](http://david.timmons.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/react-csv-component.jpg){.project-img

This is a React/Flux module written in *JSX* and *Javascript (ES2015)*
that simulates a CSV (Comma-Separated Value) spreadsheet. It features
arithmetic string parsing using the shunting-yard algorithm, undo and
redo state tracking, customizable row and column counts, an optional
highlighted footer row, and data export into a CSV file (for modern
browsers.)

*Hacka\_finder* is a single-page Web application (SPA) that matches
registered users into hackathon teams based on skills, event goals, and
location.

This app uses a modern approach to Web application design where most of
the "heavy lifting" is done on the client side. *AngularJS* and
*Bootstrap* power the front end while *Node.js* with *Express* and
*MongoDB* power the back end. Registered users search for upcoming
hackathons then find a team to join based on their unique search
criteria.

*Hacka\_finder* is a learning project built to study the MEAN stack
(MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) and Web app development. I read
six books and many API references to learn all the technologies then
started building. This is the result!

Circuit](http://david.timmons.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/simon-says-breadboard.jpg){.project-img
.shadow .aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-2290}

This *Arduino* project is similar to the electronic memory games made
popular in the 1980s. It uses a microcontroller and a variant of the C
programming language. The program creates a randomized sequence of
progressively complex LED flashes. A player must memorize the pattern
and input the correct sequence.

This version gives the player three chances. After entering an incorrect
pattern three times, the game is over. The player can reset the game by
moving the board to activate the tilt switch.

*Text Scalpel App* is a Python *Flask* Web application designed using
the MVC architecture pattern.

A user enters his or her name then uploads a text document. The app
parses this file to find word counts and display a list of the most
common words. It also generates a random text paragraph using words
pulled from the file. Results are stored in a *SQLite* database using
relational tables that link users to their text analysis results.

![Browser
Checklist](http://david.timmons.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/browser-checklist.jpg){.project-img
.shadow .aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-2282}

JavaScript drives this checklist application. It provides users an
interactive todo list using vanilla JavaScript, local storage,
geolocation, and the *Google Maps* API without the overhead of extensive
JavaScript libraries. *Modernizr* detects available browser features.
The application attempts to save tasks to local storage and falls back
to cookies when local storage is unavailable.

[»]{.headline-image}Fortune 100 Pricing Tool
--------------------------------------------

![Fortune 100 Pricing
Tool](http://david.timmons.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/fortune-100-pricing-tool.jpg){.project-img
.shadow .aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-2258}

This tool suite supports the sales function at a *Fortune 100*
corporation. It determines customer eligibility for current promotional
offers based on geography and product selection then exports a price
quote into a standalone document.

I built this tool entirely in *Microsoft Excel* using a
*Model-View-Controller* (MVC) pattern. Here's how it works:

1.  Shows current prices and user interaction controls on visible
    worksheets.
2.  Stores all price points and discounts within hidden worksheets that
    act as an application database.
3.  Enables user interaction controls to interface with approximately
    2,000 lines of code written in the Microsoft *Visual Basic for
    Applications* (VBA) language.
4.  Updates the hidden database worksheets and the visible interface
    worksheets based on user interactions that access the VBA code.

[»]{.headline-image}Website Animation Control Panel
---------------------------------------------------

![Website Animation Control
Panel](http://david.timmons.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/website-animation-control-panel.jpg){.project-img
.shadow .aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-2257}

This animation control panel enables non-technical content managers to
enter desired text within a modified *WordPress* interface then select a
custom animation style and timing for each entered phrase. Animated
phrases appear on the homepage in specified order with the custom
animations applied. The project weight is approximately 200 lines of
code. Here's how it works:

1.  Injects specified animation options into each HTML tag containing an
    animated phrase.
2.  Constructs a JavaScript object containing all user-defined animation
    attributes associated with a phrase.
3.  Places all such objects into a queue.
4.  Strips each queued object of extraneous HTML tags to isolate the
    text nodes.
5.  Recursively plays each animation according to the options stored in
    the queued object.

Development](http://david.timmons.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/front-end-web-development.jpg){.project-img
.shadow .aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-2268}

My experience with front-end Web development includes responsive and
fluid design, landing pages, email templates, and *WordPress* themes.
While I build certain projects from scratch, I base many others on
standards-compliant frameworks, such as *HTML5 Boilerplate*, to
circumvent the many browser quirks confronting modern Web development.
My Web projects often include *jQuery* or vanilla JavaScript and a
healthy dose of SEO.
