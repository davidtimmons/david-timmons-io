My name is **David Timmons**. Software engineering and entrepreneurship
are my passions. I particularly love studying new programming languages,
exploring new business ideas, and of course, building software.

**Current favorite technologies:**<br>
JavaScript \[ES2015+, Node.js\], Python, Rust, SQL

My career approach has always been motivated by a strong, innate desire
to learn. I am continually driven to seek new ideas, acquire new skills,
and refine existing abilities. Software engineering is my primary focus,
though my career spans many years in business with an emphasis on
technology, data, and marketing. I have worked at startups, been
embedded in teams at Verizon, and have run my own business.

I can work throughout the software stack and enjoy each subject area,
including front-end, back-end, database, and operations. Studying new
programming languages and browser technologies is particularly
fascinating to me.

I currently work as a full stack software engineer at Roll Forward, creator
of the Towny mobile app. I work with Node.js, MariaDB, React Native, and
AngularJS to maintain our backend systems, support our business users, and
contribute to our mobile product.

Feel free to look around, and if you have any questions or want to talk,
[please send me an email](mailto:{{ social.email }} "Click here to email me.").
